    <h2>How to Make Lasagna</h2>
    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>For this recipe, we are needing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Noodles</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
    </ul>


    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong>  with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong> until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    
    </ol>
